## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my JavaScript skills, especially working with JSON and objects. Although I focused more on JavaScript, I also encountered some CSS challenges and learned new techniques. There are two main issues I couldn't resolve:

- The spacing between cards on mobile devices is inconsistent, resulting in double gaps.
- The background color of the cards "bleeds" through because the cards are the same size.

Despite these issues, I'm satisfied with the outcome and look forward to future projects.

### Continued Development

I consider this project complete based on my current knowledge and do not plan to revisit it.
